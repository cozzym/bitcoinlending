# Lending Rates in a Bitcoin World

**How interest rates work when money can't be printed**

---

## Q1: In our current system, how are lending rates set?

**A:** Today it's a mix of **central-bank policy** and **market forces**.

### The Process:

1. **Central Bank Sets Base Rate**
   - The central bank (ECB/Fed/BoE) sets a short-term policy rate

2. **Influences Interbank Rates**
   - Banks adjust what they charge each other

3. **Cascades to All Rates**
   - Mortgage rates
   - Business loan rates
   - Government bond yields

On top of that, markets add **spreads** for different risks (e.g. junk bonds vs government bonds).

**Summary:** The current system has a **"base rate" decided by a small committee**, and everything else is built on top of that.

## Q2: In a Bitcoin-based system, would interest or lending rates still exist?

**A:** **Yes, absolutely.**

Bitcoin changes the **money**, not human nature.

### Three Key Points:

1. **People Still Borrow**
   - To buy homes, start businesses, invest

2. **People Still Lend**
   - To earn a return on savings

3. **Interest Still Exists**
   - The "extra" you pay back is still the lending rate

**Key Insight:** Bitcoin doesn't remove lending; it just removes the **ability to create new money to influence it**.

## Q3: So if there's no central bank setting a base rate, what actually determines the lending rate?

**A:** In a Bitcoin world, the lending rate is set **purely by the market**, based on three things:

### 1. Time Preference

> "If I lend you 1 BTC today, how much more do I need in the future to make it worthwhile giving it up now?"

### 2. Risk of Default

> "What is the chance you don't pay me back? Higher risk → higher rate."

### 3. Opportunity Cost of Holding Bitcoin

> "If I can simply **hold BTC** and its purchasing power tends to rise over time (because prices fall with productivity), any loan has to beat that."

So the lending rate has to be attractive relative to "just hodling".

### Supply and Demand Do the Rest

- **Rates go UP when:** Lots of people want to borrow and few want to lend
- **Rates go DOWN when:** Many are happy to lend and few want to borrow

**Conclusion:** No committee, no policy meetings – just a **price for time and risk**, like any other price.

## Q4: But in the current system, central banks also try to stabilise the economy with rates. What replaces that?

**A:** In a Bitcoin system, you **don't** have a central body that adjusts rates to "steer" the economy.

### Instead:

- **Periods of over-borrowing** are checked by **rising market rates** and real defaults (because there's no money printing to smooth it over).

- **Periods of high saving** push rates **down**, encouraging more investment.

**Insight:** You still get cycles, but they're driven more by **real conditions** (how much people want to save vs borrow) rather than policy decisions plus new money creation.

---

## Q5: Does Bitcoin make lending rates higher or lower?

**A:** It depends on the context, but the logic shifts:

### Comparison:

| Fiat System | Bitcoin System |
|-------------|----------------|
| You often need **higher nominal rates** just to stay ahead of inflation. | If prices are slowly **falling** on average (thanks to productivity), then even a **low nominal rate** can be a good **real** return. |

### Example:

- **Prices fall by:** ~3% per year
- **Loan at nominal:** 1–2%
- **Result:** Can still leave the lender better off in real terms, because the BTC they're repaid with buys more.

### The Key Change

So the key change is not "higher vs lower", it's:

> **Nominal rates can be lower, yet still meaningful in real terms, because the money isn't being devalued in the background.**

## Q6: What about government borrowing and a "risk-free rate" in Bitcoin?

**A:** Governments could still issue **Bitcoin-denominated bonds**, but:

### Constraints:

- ❌ They can't ask a central bank to create new BTC to support their borrowing.

- ✅ Lenders will set the rate purely based on:
  - The government's fiscal position
  - Its track record
  - Political stability

### Transformation of "Risk-Free Rate"

**Old Definition:**
> "The rate a central bank declares and can support with a printer."

**→**

**New Definition:**
> "The yield on the safest Bitcoin borrowers, as judged by the market."

---

## Q7: In one sentence, how is the lending rate set in a Bitcoin world?

**A:** In a Bitcoin world, the lending rate is simply the **market price of time and risk in a fixed-supply money**: savers and borrowers negotiate it directly, without central banks creating new units or using policy rates to push it up or down.

---

## Final Comparison: Fiat System vs Bitcoin System

### Fiat System

- 🏦 Central bank sets base rate
- 🖨️ Can print money to support rates
- 📋 Committee decides policy
- 📉 Inflation erodes real returns

### Bitcoin System

- 🤝 Market sets all rates
- 🔒 Fixed supply (21M)
- ⚖️ Supply & demand decide
- 📈 Deflation rewards savers

## Key Takeaways

1. **Interest rates still exist** in a Bitcoin world - people still borrow and lend
2. **Market forces, not committees**, determine rates based on time preference, risk, and opportunity cost
3. **Lower nominal rates** can provide meaningful real returns in a deflationary environment
4. **No money printing** means no artificial manipulation of lending rates
5. **Government bonds** become truly market-priced without central bank support
6. **Economic cycles** are driven by real conditions, not monetary policy
